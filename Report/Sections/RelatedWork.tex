Competitors of this challenge share some of their proposals/solutions in the Otto challenge forum. They make use of different techniques in order to get a high score on the leaderboard. Some of them include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Preprocessing data (tf-idf or log)
	\item Hyper-parameter tuning
	\item Classifier calibration (post-processing)
	\item Combining multiple different learning algorithms
\end{itemize} 

Some of this competitors have considerably good experience regarding Machine Learning, therefore throughout these paper some of the methods previously mentioned will be implemented and compared with the results obtained.
