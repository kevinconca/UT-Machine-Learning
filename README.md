## [Otto challenge description](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge)

```
For this competition, we have provided a dataset with 93 features for more than 200,000 products. 
The objective is to build a predictive model which is able to distinguish between our main product 
categories. The winning models will be open sourced.

## Software
* Anaconda
  * Pyhton
  * scikit-learn
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib

## Brief summary

Unfortunately I wasn't able to recover the full jupyter notebooks containing all the results presented in the [report](Report/Paper.pdf). However, I include base code which can be extended at will.

The goal was to build and ensemble method containing a Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests and Gradient Boosting to reduce a _multi-class logarithmic loss_.
